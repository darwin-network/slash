welcome to darwin.network, teh biggest network for clowns and clown allies on
the entire ivp6 address space. Coincidentally, darwin.network is also the
testind ground for all IRCv3 feature development.

HERE ARE THE RULES:
* no having fun.
* you must wear yuour clown wig and clown shoes at all times.
* arguing about programming language is not only expected, it is required.
* you must submit a blodo sample directly to clown HQ (aka Shivaran's house)
  and your blood must contain at least 5% midiclownians.

 * Note: please do not make this dependent on currently being in
 * the channel or on IRC; this would give an unfair advantage to
 * 24*7 clients and bots.

To be perfectly honest, if you can't figure this out you should be running
neither IRCd nor services.
