Account registration FAQ
========================

1. How do I register my nickname / account?

Use this command, substituting your desired password and e-mail address:

/msg NickServ register mySecretPassword validEmailAddress@example.com

The server will dispatch a verification code and further instructions to
your e-mail address. Ask in #darwin if you have problems.

2. How do I authenticate to my nickname?

You should enable SASL in your client. Freenode's guide covers many popular
clients:

<a href="https://freenode.net/kb/answer/sasl">https://freenode.net/kb/answer/sasl</a>

If your client is not listed, it may have its own documentation or help pages.

Note that many clients only support a single password field. In this case, you
should configure your SASL password as the password and omit the server
password (`smellyoulater`) entirely; the server will accept a successful SASL
authentication in place of the server password.

If your client doesn't support SASL, there are potential workarounds;
you may be able to script your client to authenticate to NickServ
automatically, with `/msg NickServ identify nickname password`.
Ask in #darwin for support with this.

3. What are the benefits of registering my nickname?

The primary benefit of nickname registration is that the server can act
as an "IRC bouncer" on your behalf. Specifically:

  a. No one else will be able to use your nickname
  b. If all your clients are configured to use SASL, they can all use the same
     nickname (as though they were connected to the same ZNC instance)
  c. Optionally, the server can keep you present on the server even if
     you have no connected clients. To enable this, use the following command:
     `/msg NickServ set always-on true`
  d. You will be able to receive history playback (see below).

You can also request a vhost (i.e., a fake hostname that will be displayed
in place of your cloaked IP-based hostname), using the command
`/msg HostServ request desired.vhost`. An operator will review this request
(and most likely grant it).

4. How does server-side history work?

darwin.network retains up to 14 days of chat history on the server side,
stored in an on-disk database. All messages are purged once they
reach the 14-day age limit. Furthermore, access to history is restricted
so that users can only replay messages that they could have received
normally when they were sent. Specifically:

  a. Anonymous users cannot view messages sent more than 1 hour before
     they connected to the server. This allows people to join and see
     the context of the current discussion, but not to probe into past
     conversations.
  b. Logged-in users cannot view messages sent more than 1 hour before
     their account was registered. This is equivalent to having had a
     personal IRC client or bouncer connected since the time of registration.

By default:

  c. Messages sent to an unregistered channel are stored in-memory
     ("ephemeral history"), but not in the database.
  d. Messages sent to a registered channel are stored in the database.
     As the owner of a registered channel, you can disable this with
     `/msg ChanServ set history ephemeral` (or `set history off`).
  e. Direct messages for logged-out clients are stored in-memory.
  f. Direct messages for logged-in clients are stored in the database.
     You can disable this with `/msg NickServ set dm-history ephemeral`
     (or `set history off`).

Unfortunately, client support for history playback is lagging behind our
server-side support:

  g. The most convenient way to access server-side history
     is with our fully self-hosted <a href="https://irc.darwin.network/kiwi/">Kiwi IRC</a> instance, which can play back
     history on request.
  h. If your client supports ZNC's <a href="https://wiki.znc.in/Playback">playback</a> module, you can use it
     to replay only the lines you missed. For example, in <a href="https://www.codeux.com/textual/">Textual</a>,
     go to "Server properties", select "Vendor specific", uncheck "Do not
     automatically join channels on connect", and check "Only play back messages
     you missed". Other clients with support are listed on ZNC's wiki page.
  i. You can manually request recent channel history by issuing the command:
     /quote history #channel
  k. If you are not using the multi-client feature, you can set your account
     to auto-replay messages that were sent while you were logged out
     (similar to the default behavior of ZNC). To enable this, send:
     /msg NickServ set always-on true
     /msg NickServ set autoreplay-missed true

5. I'm trying to add a client certificate, but it doesn't work --- why not?

Try connecting to port 6698 instead of port 6697 (keep TLS enabled).
